# 🛡️ Fake Medicine Detector App - NEXT STEPS ROADMAP
## Comprehensive Development Plan - October 2025

---

## __🛠️ MAINTENANCE GUIDE:__

### __To Modify Points System:__

1. __Update default__: Change `@default(5)` in schema
2. __Add operations__: Create balance transaction functions
3. __Update UI__: Modify components to reflect changes
4. __Test thoroughly__: Ensure no negative balances

### __Scaling Considerations:__

- __For high-traffic__: Consider Redis session storage
- __For complex logic__: Move balance logic to service layer
- __For real-time updates__: Consider WebSocket integration

This custom session behavior ensures your points balance system remains __secure, performant, and type-safe__ throughout your authentication flow! 🚀
